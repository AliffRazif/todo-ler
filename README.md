# Project 2 - Todo-ler

## Name
Todo-ler

## Overview
* The app is a to-do list app where the user can create tasks, set a due date, and check off the task once it has been completed. 
* User information is stored in a MongoDB database.
* The tasks can be be edited to be updated. 
* There is user authentication and each user will has their own account where they can see the tasks that they have created. 
* Tasks can also be deleted. 


## Challenges
* The creation of the user authentication system was a bit challenging due to linking tasks to the created user using the username in the database.
* Trying to add certain fields in the date format. 
* Repopulating the edit fields with data from the database for the date format. That took while to figure out.

## Technology in Use

* EJS,CSS,MongoDB, and Vanilla Javascript.
* EJS Partials,bcrypt, mongoose, method-override


## Notes For the Future

* Create a personalized homepage for the user where they will be welcome and a message will display based on their name. 
* Make buttons better looking.
